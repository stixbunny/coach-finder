# Coach Finder

Hello! This project was developed during Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/). It is the main project of the course. It is a SPA for contacting coaches.

Users can register into the platform through firebase user authorization and then create their coach profile. Users can also contact coaches listed on the site by leaving them a message. The list of coaches can be filtered by the type of coach. The data is kept on firebase and fetched either manually or when going to the /coaches route.

During it's development I implemented on my own "script setup" syntax as well as Pinia for state management, given the original course was mainly on "Options API" and Vuex. I also made it on Vite as opposed to Vue-CLI.
